Layout of data:
data = [
    {Date: "10/27/2021", Work: 1, School: 2, Life: 1, Exercise: 1, Happiness: 6},
    .
    .
    .
    etc
]

How should this work tho?
- Move happiness slider to the tasks page, put it next to the calendar
- Set up database to allow post (if new date) and edit (if changed on same day) requests with happiness data
    - This would be when user clicks "confirm happiness"
    - The data being sent would be the user's current completed tasks for the day, their happiness, and the date
    - On edit requests, check if date exists, if it does, replace current datapoint for that day
    - With python this could be a dictionary such as {"10/27/2021": {Work: 5, ..., Happiness: 10}}
- On insights page, when button is clicked
